## Individual Research Project

You will research a topic of your choice, in the context of microbiomes, by reviewing 3-5 scientific publications from peer-reviewed journals. 

This research will result in a review paper and a class presentation that describe the state of current scientific knowledge in that given topic. 

Some suggested topics are:

- Microorganisms and the anthropocene
- Access and benefit sharing of genetic resources (ethics of biotech economy)
- Astronaut Microbiome Research
- Microbiome in extreme environments
- Microbiome collections / libraries
- Social / Cultural microbiome practices / tools (c section birth inoculation, wine making, cheese making, sourdough, pickling)
- Soil microbiome and relationship to farming / planting strategies (wine making?)
- Biofilms (lichen, kombucha etc.) 
- Bioreceptive Substrates
- Bioreactors
- Climate Change in relation to the microbiome
- Microbial Communities 
- Multispecies architecture

The research project will be developped as three assignments: 

### Outline

- abstract (250 words)
- detailed outline
- list of references

### First Draft

- abstract (250 words)
- introduction
- summary
- analysis
- synthesis
- conclusion

### Final Draft

Same sections as first draft, with edits and improvements. 

### Presentation

You will lead a 20 minute discussion on your research topic: roughly 10 min presentation, and 10 min discussion. Prepare powerpoint slides or other visual material to lead the discussion.
