## Group Project



Number of Students: 3-4 per group

### Group Project Deliverables:

* An iterated prototype of an object, app or other interface that defines a novel interaction with the environmental microbiome. 

* A website documenting the process of creation of aforementioned project (see below for details)

* A short video pitching the aforementioned project (2-3 minutes)


### The website should contain: 

LANDING PAGE: this page should include the title, a 2-3 sentence description, 1-3 images, and a 2-3 minute video. 

TABS/SCROLL DOWN TO:
- introduction and background research: a summary of the scientific articles you have reviewed for your background research (2-5 pages). This is similar to the work you did for your individual research papers. The background section leads to an open question in the field, or an unmet need. This could be a present-day need, or one that you speculate to be relevant in a near future. End it by a statement that places your project in the context of what you have just described. 
- project description and rationale: summarize here your project - is it a game, an installation, a wearable, an instrument? How does it work and who uses it? Describe how the overall design of this project addresses the open question you arrived to in your Background section. You can use the [DARPA Heilmeier classification](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism) as guidance for this section. 
- process: document your research process here. Photos/videos/screenshots/transcripts of conversations and interviews are all helpful to describe your process. 
- discussion: discuss the themes of Values, Feasibility, Compatibility, Human Impact, Sustainability and Risk as described in the [Biodesign Challenge Rules](https://biodesignchallenge.org/judging-rubric). You should write at least a 200 word paragraph for each topic that discusses your project in relationship to the given theme. The quality of the discussion (identifying the risks/shortcomings of the design) is more important than claiming that there are none. 
- team: headshots (if you want) and brief bios of each team member, with links to personal sites/portfolios. 




One group will be selected to present at the BioDesign Challenge at MoMA in June. 



Projects will be evaluated according the [BioDesign Challenge criteria](https://biodesignchallenge.org/judging-rubric):

### FEASIBILITY


**A. Scientific**

How well has the team demonstrated that trends in current science indicate that their vision will be possible?

**B. Cultural**

How deeply has the team considered whether biotech is the most appropriate response to this issue, as opposed to other technologies or social solutions? Has it considered how this vision fits into or replaces already-built cultural and material systems?


### HUMAN IMPACT

**A. Users/Nonusers/Scalability**

How deeply has the team considered how the design changes the lives of those who use it and those who don't use it? These might include workers involved in its manufacture as well as those who don't have access to the design or can't afford to pay for it. Has the team considered how widely its design might be used, including among different genders, races, and socioeconomic groups?

**B. Ethics**

How well has the team considered ethics imbued in their vision? Does its vision challenge or reaffirm the ethics of those for whom it’s meant and/or those by which it was created?


### SUSTAINABILITY

**A. Environmental Impact**

How deeply has the team considered its design's interaction with living environments? How might the project change the living environment? For good, bad, both?

**B. Efficiency/Life Cycle**

How well does the project consider the use of resources (e.g. water, feedstocks, energy, labor, etc.)? Has the team considered their design’s entire life cycle? How is it sourced? Can it be recycled or reused in other ways?

###  RISK

Has the team considered the potential negative effects of its vision?

**A. Safety**  
Has the team accounted for possible harm to human health and the living environment associated with its product or process malfunctioning? Has the team changed their design to mitigate these risks?

**B. Dual use**  
In the hands of someone with ill intent, any design can be used nefariously. A hammer, meant to bang in nails, can be turned into a murder weapon when swung at a person. Nuclear technology can be harnessed to create energy, but also to create a bomb. Has the team considered how their design might be harnessed for ill intent? Has the team considered how its design could be negatively exploited, and how to mitigate that risk?
